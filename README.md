# Infinite Scroll Image Grid

This project is a technical challenge designed to evaluate frontend development skills. It displays a grid of images fetched from a public API, featuring infinite scroll, image removal on click, and responsive layout.

## Task requirements

- Complete the user story below
- Your code should compile (if necessary) and run in one step. It is ok if there is a build process.
- Javascript should be used as a plataform.
- Feel free to use whatever frameworks / libraries / packages you like.
- Styles can be added with frameworks, libraries, plain css, preprocessors or postprocessors, be imaginative!
- You must use this placeholder URL for getting the images: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/photos
 
 
## Nice to have:
- Include tests is a plus.
- The images canâ€™t pop or flicker, they must appear smoothly on the screen.

## User Story
- As a user visiting the root URL
- I can see a grid of images that fill the screen on load
- When I scroll the browser, I see more images loaded
- When I click an image It is removed from the list and disappears

## Acceptance criteria
- The grid should be responsive, showing 2 columns on small devices and more as the
device width growths
